## Comments
Originally, the project is built on mongodb, but our teacher said that we have to use mysql, which freaks us out.
The migration costs me 3 days, just simple signin/signup function. Different database is like different OS. Why teacher user command us to do so ? He wants us to compare rational database and non-rational database(HBase). By the way, even though I hate the migration, I learned a lot.
